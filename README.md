# JetDevsHomeWork

Welcome to the RXSwift MVVM Login task created as JetDevsHomeWork!

The JetDevsHomeWork is a demonstration of a modern iOS application that incorporates RXSwift and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This app showcases a user-friendly login screen that performs API calls to authenticate users and manage their access.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

|----------------|---------------|------------------|
|      XCode     |     Swift     |    CocoaPods     | 
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 14.2 or higher | 5.0 or higher | 1.12.0 or higher |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|

## Installation

- Cloning the repository by using below repo:
git clone https://github.com/JaySharma29/LoginPageWithMVVM.git

- pod install
- Opening the project in Xcode:
- open JetDevsHomeWork.xcworkspace

## Usage

- By implementing this task within our application, users can initiate the login process. Once authenticated, they will be automatically directed to their personalized profile screen, where essential user details are showcased prominently. Additionally, any X-Acc value obtained from the response header during this process will be saved and available for further usage.

## Features

This implementation encompasses the following aspects:

### MVVM Architecture: 
#### The application is structured according to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting modularity.

### Login Screen UI with Validation: 
#### The user interface for the login screen has been designed to incorporate input validation, offering a seamless and secure login experience.

### User Data Persistence and Account Binding: 
#### User data is intelligently stored to maintain a consistent user experience. This data is then seamlessly bound to the account section, ensuring that user-specific information is readily accessible.

### RXCocoa and RXSwift Integration: 
#### RXCocoa and RXSwift libraries are skillfully employed to facilitate real-time observation of text changes in the interface and to efficiently manage asynchronous API calls, enhancing the overall responsiveness and user interactivity of the application.
